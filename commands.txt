ls -- listing
cd -- change directory
cp -- for copy <cp source_directory destination_directory>
mkdir -- for making a new folder
mv -- for moving things around <mv source_directory destination_directory>

rm and rmdir -- deleting 
    •You can skip the confirmation by typing:
        rm –f <file>
        But use at your own peril! There’s no undo. 
    •To delete entire directories you need to use the –r flag,
        just as was the case with cp.
        rm –r <directory>
    • You can also combine the –r and –f flags into –rf.
    Again, careful! There’s no undo!

rename <rm <old> <new>>
